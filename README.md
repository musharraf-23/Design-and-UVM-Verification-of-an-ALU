# Design-and-UVM-Verification-of-an-ALU
This project presents the design and UVM verification environment for an Arithmetic Logic Unit, a key component in digital systems. The UVM test bench was developed to ensure functional correctness and robustness, providing hands-on experience in both digital logic design and industry-standard verification methodologies.
